# Mine-or-Rock-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model that classifies sonar signals as either Mine (M) or Rock (R) using the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset. It applies Logistic Regression to analyze underwater acoustic signals and predict whether the object detected by sonar is dangerous (mine) or harmless (rock).
